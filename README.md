This project Surveys the technology landscape

Good developers regularly check in on the news in their field -- every day, not every week or month! In order to stay up to date, you will need to do the following in order to create your own dashboard: 

List out the technologies in which you're interested.

List out some news sites where you could find tech-related news.

Create a dashboard that will help you stay up to date (for example a dashboard on Feedly), including the latest updates from the sites you listed above. 

Create a Twitter account (if you don't already have one) and follow different influencers in the world of web development.

# Deliverables
A screenshot of your tech dashboard (make sure to explore the dashboard with your mentor over Hangouts).
A link to your Twitter account "Following" tab, so it's obvious who you've chosen to follow. If you've chosen a private account, show your Twitter account to your mentor over Hangouts.

For your deliverables to be processed by the jury, upload all project deliverables onto the platform in a folder named "PTech_first_name". Each deliverable must be named with the project number and in the order in which it appears, e.g. "PTech_01_techdashboard", "PTech_02_Twitter"
